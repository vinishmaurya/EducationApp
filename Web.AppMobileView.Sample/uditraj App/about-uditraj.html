		<h2>About Dr. Udit Raj</h2>
            <p class="text"><strong>EARLY LIFE:</strong> Dr. Udit Raj (Ex-IRS) is Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha from North-West Delhi. He is also the National Chairman of the All India Confederation of SC/ST Organizations. An influential leader from the Bharatiya Janata Party, he is admired nationally as a social activist for Dalits.<br><br>
			
<strong>EARLY LIFE & EDUCATION:</strong> Dr. Udit Raj was born in Ram Nagar village of Allahabad district, Uttar Pradesh to Shri Kallan Singh and Smt. Sukh Dei. After completing his intermediate studies at his native place, he took admission at Jawahar Lal Nehru University, New Delhi in 1980. Right from his college days, he has been actively involved in many socio-political activities, which at times, also affected his studies. Due to financial constraints, he was forced to divert his attention from social activities. He started preparing for Civil Services Examination thereafter, and cleared the same in 1988, when he was selected for the elite Indian Revenue Service. His first posting was at Ghaziabad as Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in the year 1990.<br><br> He was transferred to Delhi in 1995 where he served at the reputed posts of Deputy Commissioner, Joint commissioner and Additional Commissioner of Income Tax. Besides the M.A and L.L.B degrees, he has been awarded a Doctorate Degree Honoris Causa by an international university. His intellectual acumen is recognized in U.S.A and Europe. He frequently holds dialogue with Congressmen of U.S.A and members of the European Parliament. He is also a prolific writer and till now, 355 articles have been published in various national newspapers. There was no organization for the alumni of the Jawahar Lal Nehru University, and he was one of the founder members of the organization.	<br><br>

<strong>PERSONAL LIFE:</strong> During his training at the National Academy of Direct Taxes, he happened to meet Seema Bahl. Apart from being batchmates, they shared similar ideology and perspective towards life. They married in 1990. Mrs. Seema Raj is presently serving as the Commissioner of Income Tax. They have a son, Abhiraj and a daughter Saveri. Udit Raj’s younger brother is a former MLA. In the year 2003, he resigned from the post of Additional Commissioner of Income Tax to devote himself completely for socio-political causes.<br><br>

<strong>PROFESSIONAL LIFE:</strong> In the year 1997, five anti-reservation orders were issued by the government leading to a tumultuous situation in the country. Organizations with different intellectuals and departments from all over the country joined hands and All India Confederation of SC/ST Organization was formed. Dr. Udit Raj was appointed as its National president. Under his leadership, various campaigns were initiated and demonstrations were held all over the country against anti-reservation orders. Various national level rallies were organized in Delhi during 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The media created competition between the rallies organized by him and BSP, which Dr Udit Raj turned in his favour.<br><br>

It was due to his efforts that the Atal Bihari Government passed the 81st, 82nd and 85th Constitutional amendments, which in turn led to the retrieval of reservation benefits. Following in the footsteps of Dr Ambedkar, Dr. Udit Raj has been assiduously working for a casteless society, free from all discrimination and divisive system of the Hindu caste hierarchy.<br><br>

Dr. Udit Raj joined the Bhartiya Janta Party after he was convinced of its sincere interest in the inclusive growth of all sections of the society including the welfare of the SC/ST and backward sections, besides upholding the integrity and unity of the nation. The poor performance of the corruption-ridden Congress Party, particularly in the last decade, both in respect of the economy and the welfare of vast multitudes of people, has also been greatly responsible for moulding his opinion in favour of BJP.	<br><br>
	
<strong>CRUSADER FOR JUSTICE:</strong> Dr Udit Raj has been raising issues of the downtrodden and deprived people at United Nations Organization, Geneva. He also acts as the Chairman of the Buddha Education Foundation and Dalit International Foundation. He is also an Editor of a bi-lingual fortnightly magazine captioned ‘Voice of Buddha’. In 1997, he raised the issues faced by lakhs of underprivileged people and resolved many of them. He launched a campaign in 2006 for seeking reservation for backward sections in the institutions of higher education. Again in 2006, when Samajwadi Party acquired land from the farmers and allotted it to Reliance Company, a campaign was started under the leadership of former Prime Minister Shree V.P. Singh for the return of this land. Dr. Udit Raj played a stellar role in this movement, courting arrest against its implementation. In 2008-2009, he exposed a big scam in Delhi Development Authority which led to the accused persons landing in jail and hence, justice delivered. It also set fear in the DDA employees about indulging in any corrupt practices in the future.<br><br>

He also launched a struggle against the four-year degree course syllabus which is detrimental to the cause of education. Dr. Udit Raj has held prestigious positions in some important committees of the Government of India. He was a member of National Integration Council, chaired by the Hon’ble Prime Minister himself. Presently, he is a member of the National Monitoring Committee for Education of SC/ST & PWD, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India where he has effectively represented the educational interests of SC/ST people and other deprived sections of the society.
