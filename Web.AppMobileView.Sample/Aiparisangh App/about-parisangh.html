The All India Confederation of SC/ST Organisation was formed in 1997 
under the leadership of Dr. Udit Raj. From that time, we have been 
fighting for the rights of Dalits and Adivasis. A social movement has 
its limitations, keeping this in mind Dr. Udit Raj decided to fight for 
the movement politically. He started his own political party, but due to
 the lack of resources and expected support from society, Dr. Udit Raj 
joined the Bharatiya Janta Party before the General Elections in 2014, 
and became a Member of the Lok Sabha. In the Lok Sabha, he raised issues
 relating to Dalits, Adivasis and the poor. He has raised issues 
relating to reservation in promotion, validity of caste certificate of 
one state throughout the country, SCP/TSP, reservation in minority 
institutions such as the Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia 
Islaima University, participation of Dalits in small and medium 
enterprises, scholarships for SC/ST students as well as issues relating 
to discrimination against SC/ST students in Parliament. He has also 
introduced a private member Bill for reservation in promotion in 
Parliament, as well as Bills seeking to provide free hostel facility to 
SC/ST students, benefits to unemployed youth etc.<br><br>

A
 brief note about the achievements of the All India Confederation of 
SC/ST Organisations under the leadership of Dr. Udit Raj is being given 
below.<br><br>In
 1997, 5 anti reservation orders were issued on 30th January, 2nd July, 
22nd July, 13th August and 29th July; the All India Confederation of 
SC/ST Organisations was formed to fight against these orders. Under the 
banner of the Confederation, the first rally was held on 26th November 
1997, second on 16th November 1998, third on 13th December 1999 and the 
fourth on 11th December 2000 in Delhi. Due to these rallies, an 
environment of revolution gripped the country, and the Government bowed 
down before this. <br><br>Due
 to this movement by the Confederation, the anti-reservation orders were
 withdrawn. On one hand, reservation in Government service was saved, 
but due to outsourcing and privatisation, these rights are also being 
lost. In 2000, there were approximately 40 lac SC/ST employees working 
in the Central and various State Governments; now this number has shrunk
 approximately to 27 lac. Now our participation cannot continue without 
reservation in private sector. No other scheme or policy even comes 
close to providing benefits we have received through reservation in 
Government service. In Lok Sabha, due to reservation, there are 122 
SC/ST Members of Parliament, which means empowerment of 122 families. In
 the 28 states of country, 4109 MLAs are elected; due to reservation, 
approximately 900 SC/ST MLAs are elected, which means empowerment of 900
 families here as well. At present, there are 27 lac employees in 
Government service, which means social and economic upliftment of these 
families. Now most jobs are being generated in the private sector, hence
 to call the fight for reservation in private sector the second battle 
of independence is not an exaggeration. When SC/STs enter the private 
sector through reservation, they will also understand the ways of doing 
business.<br><br>Due
 to the 81st Constitutional Amendment, a new Article 16(4) (b) was 
introduced in the Constitution, due to which recruitment to backlog 
vacancies was started. Due to the orders dated 29th August 1997, backlog
 vacancies could not be filled as the Supreme Court had ordered that not
 more than 50% of the total seats to be filled up be reserved. Due to 
this Amendment, lacs of people were benefited and many unemployed also 
got jobs. This misconception should not arise that the movement was only
 for SC/ST officers. Due to the 82nd Constitutional Amendment, a 
necessary amendment was made in Article 335 of the Constitution, which 
was changed by the anti-reservation order issued on 22nd July; under 
which relaxation given in Departmental examinations was withdrawn. The 
85th Constitutional Amendment nullified the anti-reservation orders 
issued on 30th January 1997 due to which seniority and other benefits 
given to SC/ST employees were withdrawn. Thousands of employees in 
Indian Railways were demoted. A problematic situation was also created 
in various states including Punjab and Haryana. It was also due to our 
efforts that laws for reservation were passed in Maharashtra and Jammu 
and Kashmir.<br><br>Two
 anti-reservation orders are yet to be withdrawn. The post based roster 
was implemented from 2nd July 1997. Due to this, Dalits employees can be
 placed or promoted only to posts according to roster points. The 
earlier roster was 40 points, according to which 1st point was for SCs 
and 4th for STs for recruitment. In the new roster, SCs and STs are at 
7th and 14th positions respectively; which means if there are 5 or 6 
vacancies, no SC would be recruited, and if there are 13 vacancies, only
 1 SC would be recruited. While talking to many senior officers, I was 
surprised to learn that they do not know the benefits they would get if 
the 77th Constitutional Amendment was passed. <br><br>

On
 16th November 1992, in the Mandal judgment, the Supreme Court has said 
that reservation in promotion not be given to SCs. To nullify this, the 
77th Constitutional Amendment was introduced in June 1995. The wordings 
of the Amendment clearly state that reservation in promotion be given at
 every post and every stage. On 13th August 1997, the DOPT OM stated 
that reservation in promotion be given only as was continuing at that 
time; which means reservation in promotion would continue only at the 
lower levels. If the Constitutional Amendment was implemented, then at 
senior positions such as IAS, IPS etc. SC/STs could have been promoted 
to top positions such as Heads of Departments, Secretaries to the 
Government of India, Chairman Railway Board etc. It is apparent that 
only class III and class IV employees are at the forefront of the 
struggle, the benefits of which go to the entire soceity as well 
employees of other classes. Supreme Court judges also aggravated the 
situation and forced general category people and organisations to file a
 review petition against these three Constitutional Amendments, which 
was fought for them by top lawyers of the Supreme Court. On the other 
hand, the Confederation was the only one fighting, which made me realise
 the selfishness of Dalit society. Secondly, misconceptions are so high 
in this society that many employees feel they have done a lot after 
celebrating Ambedkar Jayanti in their offices; they are also prone to 
spreading nonsense.<br><br>
On
 4th November 2001, lacs of people took Deeksha to Buddhism under the 
banner of the Confederation. The intention was to gather 10 lac people 
at the Ramlila Maidan, Delhi to begin this cultural revolution. The 
Government of that time not only got cancelled the permission for the 
function at the Ramlila Maidan, but also used the police machinery to 
intimidate people coming to join the function. The fight for respect 
will not be won if a cultural revolution cannot be brought about by 
changing the mindset of people. This cultural change was brought about 
only by the Confederation, and those who had received support, money and
 time from lacs of employees, they have done nothing except to fool 
those people.<br><br>

Whether
 it be the Jhajjar issue or any other issue of exploitation, we have 
always been fighting for Dalits. Has anyone else ever gheraoed the 
Supreme Court? We had done this courageous deed on 10th August 1998. 
People blame me for forming a political party – we had done this only to
 further the aims of the Confederation. Some issues can only be taken up
 by political parties, and some only at a social level. Baniyas do not 
have a political platform, yet there voice is always heard, due to their
 financial, educational and cultural superiority. A decade back, we 
believed that due to Ambedkarite visions, our movement was also going in
 that direction, now the standards are falling rapidly. The biggest 
reason for this fall is due to the increasing casteism amongst Dalits. 
On one hand, caste based organisations are made, and on the other, they 
call themselves social activists and Ambedkarites. <br><br>

In
 2011] the entire country supported Anna Hazare’s agitation for a Lokpal
 Bill; it was only the confederation which asked if Dalits, tribals and 
backwards had any role to play in the Lopkpal. According to demands 
raised then, Parliamnet proceeding, Supreme Court, Prime Minister’s 
office and CBI ect. Would have all come under the ambit of the Lokpal. 
When we raised the issue of reservation in lokpal, then Arvind Kejriwal 
and Ann Hazare lost all interest in getting the Bill Passed. If the 
confederation had stayed silent, then perhaps the Lokpal Bill would have
 been passed and the Lokpal would have had extra – Constitutional powers
 ot the dilute the rights of India’s women, Dalits and backward as 
higher judiciary is doing now. We cerated the Bhaujan Lokpal Bill for 
reservation and this demand was accepted as well.<br><br>Casteism
 amongst Dalits has increased, due to which our strength has decreased. 
Reservation is being destroyed through outsourcing, contract system and 
disinvestment. The bill for reservation in private sector has been 
submitted in the Lok Sabha as a private member bill. A Private sector 
bill is not the responsibility of any party to pass, the onus is on 
Dalits and Adivasis. If we do not get reservation in private Sector, it 
means all the benefits and advantages we have gotten till now are in 
vain. Due to reservation in Politics and Government service, Dalits have
 been socially and economically uplifted. In areas we there is no 
reservation, such as media, private industry, arts and culture, higher 
judiciary, IT ect. The involvement of Dalits is almost zero, In the US, 
there is reservation for blacks and Hispanics- Government purchases 
their products, due to which they have become industrialists and 
businessmen. To get his right, we have to make many sacrifices. Due to 
privatisation and globalisation, education employment and wealth are all
 in private hands- lacs of crorepatis are being bron everyday. The 
judicious use of their black money has also given them a strong foothold
 in politics. Looking at the bigger cities such as Mumbai and Delhi, it 
is difficult to perceive that dalits have any role in them. 
Privatisation has led to a huge disparity in rights and privileges.<br><br>

When
 India did not have a Dalit President, it was widely discussed that a 
Dalit president might change the country. Similar discussion were held 
about the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. However, nothing much 
changed when a Dalit became the Chief Jusitce. Even though Mayawati 
became the Chief Minister of the largest state for four terms, we could 
not get reservation in private sector. Even if a Dalit becomes the Prime
 Minister, it is not likely that we will get such a right. It is also 
possible that others cna get this done, there are many complication in 
politics. If a nationwide Movement is formed for this, then every party 
would bend votes, and it is likely that we get this right Dr. Ambedkar 
stayed at 26, Alipur Road and penned the book “Buddha and his religion” 
and this where he breathed his last on 6th December, 1956 After many 
efforts, the Government purchased this property in 2003 and declared is 
as a national memorial; howerever, there no conferences or other 
activities at the site. The Dr. Ambedkar Parinirvan Samman Karyakaram 
Samiti was formed by us to ensure that this memorial gest equal status 
as Gandhiji’s memorial and we were successful in this as well. On the 
last 14th April, Prime Minister Narender Modi himself came to the venue 
and announced that the building will be renovated at a cost of Rs. 95 
crores. Even now, we demand that an Act on lines of the Rajghat Act be 
passed for renovation of 26 Alipur Road and surrounding land also be 
acquired for this purpose.
<br><br>At
 Present, most fo our agitations are for reservation in higher 
judiciary, issues of safai karamacharis, a Bill for reservation being 
placed in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution ect. It is not difficult 
to speak and discuss, but lost of efforts are required for these demands
 to be fructified. The Membership drive of the Confederation has to be 
drastically scaled up. Some things should also be learned from the upper
 caste. Thousands of unmarried, highly educated people are working for 
the RSS. Retired officers are working in several organs of the Sangh. 
There have never been conflicts regarding name and recognition in news.<br><br>

In
 our Society, due to some small egos, retired employees are neither able
 to do anything for society nor are they able to take advantage of the 
opportunities available. Exploited societies should be more devoted for 
their own rights. Training programs should be held throughout the 
country and such machinery should be able to change entire society. We 
are hopeful that the Confederation will thousands of missionaries, 
leaders and workers in every state, which can lead to the formation a 
new society.<br><br>
In
 general, Ambedkarites believe in lord Buddha. He had said that what is 
not proved should not be believed’ Lord Buddha had even said that his 
wone teachings should not be believead until they are proven. This is 
for those who discuss aobut the sacrifices of members of the All India 
Confederation of SC/ST Organizations without knowing the value of their 
sacrifices and achievement. Have we made a mistake by joining the BJP? 
Have we stopped talking about Dalit issues, are we fulfilling our own 
selfishness? Dr. Ambedkar criticized the Congress his entire life. When 
Dr. Ambedkar lost his seat in the Constituent assembly was given his 
seat and sent to the Constituent Assembly. After this. Dr. Ambedkar not 
noly became the law Minister of India, but also the Chairman of the 
Drafting Committee of the Constitution. Dr.Ambedkar fought for Dalits 
whill being in Congress; has Dr. Raj Stopped fighting for Dalits while 
in the BJP? Is this wrong? The number of issues he has raised in 
Parliamnet, and the number of works he has done; if any impartial person
 sees them, then he cannot remain without praising Dr. Udit Raj’s 
Commitment towards empowerment of Dalits.<br><br>State-wise
